# Hook
Ever have that day when you have to remind yourself for what you live and strive for? I still remember writing personal essays for college applications. Back then the questions brought more grief and anxiety than reflection. Now I see that it would have been a great opportunity for introspection and growth before I made such a decision. For one school in particular I had a very hard time coming up with a specific motivation for what I wanted to study. Coming with a subject to study or a path to follow was not the hard part. After all, I was fully indoctrinated with the idea of going to a good school to get a good job to be self-sustaining. But what was it for? Applying for college I thought that I would just pursue a deeper journey of education in science...maybe academia was somewhere in the mix. Yet something turned up. Somebody by the name of Jesus Christ.
